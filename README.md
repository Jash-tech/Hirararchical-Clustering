# Hierarchical clustering - World Bank sample dataset
One of the main goals for establishing the World Bank was to fight and eliminate poverty.
Continuous evolution and fine-tuning its policies in the ever-evolving world has been
helping the institution to achieve the goal of poverty elimination. The barometer of success
in the elimination of poverty is measured in terms of improvement of each of the
parameters in health, education, sanitation, infrastructure, and other services needed to
improve the lives of the poor. The development gains that will ensure the goals must be
pursued in an environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable manner.
